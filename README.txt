Program Explanation:
    This program prints out based on input from the user a rectangle, square, triangle and an hourglass.
        each shape is printed in turn, first its original shape, with the bounding rectangle, the same shape scaled by 2 and then
        again with the bounding rectangle.
        All that while displaying their info.

List of files:
    Sources:
        main.cpp - calls the shape functions and draws them on the console, displaying their info in the process.
        Board.cpp - contains the initialization of all function related to drawing on the console etc.
        Vertex.cpp - contains the initialization of all function related to actions/checks on dots.
        Utilites.cpp - contains couple of functions related to specific checks for the dots.
        Rectangle.cpp - contains the initialization of functions related to rectangle drawing, checks etc.
        Square.cpp - contains the initialization of functions related to square drawing, checks etc.
        Triangle.cpp - contains the initialization of functions related to triangle drawing, checks etc.
        Hourglass.cpp - contains the initialization of functions related to hourglass drawing, checks etc.

    Include:
        Board.h - contains the declaration of all Board functions.
        Vertex.h - contains the declaration of all Vertex functions.
        Utilities.h - contains the declaration of all Utilities functions.
        Rectangle.h - contains the declaration of all Rectangle functions.
        Square.h - contains the declaration of all board functions.
        Triangle.h - contains the declaration of all Triangle functions.
        Hourglass.h - contains the declaration of all Hourglass functions.
        macros.h - contains the limit values of the dots.
